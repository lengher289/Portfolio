This tool's primary purpose is to streamline the process of checking attendance for the My Food Program that WADS utilizes and reports to. This tool can also be altered to work for educational institutions, businesses, or any organization that needs to keep track of attendance records for various participants over time. The program allows users to input the name of an Excel file, read the attendance data, and provide a summary of attended days for each participant, excluding unattended days.\n","\n","## Features:\n","\n","### File Validation:\n","\n","> The program first validates the existence of the specified Excel file in the Monthly Attendance folder. If the file is not found, the user is notified.\n","\n","### Data Extraction:\n","\n","> Once a valid Excel file is found, the program reads its contents using the Pandas library. The attendance data is loaded into a DataFrame, making it easy to manipulate and analyze.\n","\n","### Data Parsing:\n","\n","> The program handles date strings in the Excel file, converting them into datetime objects for accurate date manipulation.\n","\n","### Attendance Insights:\n","\n","> For each participant, the program identifies the days they attended. It filters out unattended days and presents the attended days in a clear and concise format.\n","\n","### User-Friendly Interface:\n","\n","> The user interacts with the program by providing the name of the Excel file. The program then processes the data and displays the attendance insights.\n","\n","## Usage:\n","\n","1. Input File Name: The user is prompted to enter the name of the Excel file they want to analyze. The program verifies the file's existence and proceeds with data extraction.\n","2. Attendance Insights Display: The program presents attendance insights for each participant, showing the attended days in the \"Month/Day\" format. This format excludes the year to simplify the presentation.\n","3. Handling Missing Files: If the specified Excel file is not found, the program notifies the user and provides an opportunity to check the file name.\n","\n","\n","# Conclusion:\n","\n","> The Attendance Insights Extractor is a valuable tool for WADS that rely on accurate attendance records. It simplifies the process of extracting attendance insights from Excel files and presents the information in an easily digestible format. Users can quickly identify the days each participant attended, making it a useful resource for monitoring participation and making data-driven decisions\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"M1oHcqhNUUJo"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Q5jThbyUUQPJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","\n","def extract_attendance_insights(attendance_df):\n","    attendance_insights = {}\n","\n","    for participant_name, attendance_row in attendance_df.iterrows():\n","        attended_days = []  # List to store attended days (Month/Day)\n","\n","        for date, status in attendance_row.items():\n","            if status == 'Attended':\n","                # Parse the date string into a datetime object\n","                date_obj = datetime.strptime(date, '%m/%d/%Y')\n","                # Append the month/day to the list\n","                month_day = date_obj.strftime('%m/%d')\n","                attended_days.append(month_day)\n","\n","        # Store the attended days for this participant\n","        attendance_insights[participant_name] = attended_days\n","\n","    return attendance_insights\n","\n","def count_attendance_per_day(attendance_insights):\n","    day_participants = defaultdict(int)\n","\n","    for attended_days in attendance_insights.values():\n","        for day in attended_days:\n","            day_participants[day] += 1\n","\n","    return day_participants\n","\n","def main():\n","    # Define the path to the Monthly Attendance folder\n","    monthly_attendance_folder = '/content/drive/My Drive/Monthly Attendance/'\n","\n","    # Ask the user to enter the Excel file name\n","    excel_file_name = input(\"Enter the Excel file name (e.g., Month_Year_Attendance.xlsx): \")\n","\n","    # Define the full path to the Excel file\n","    excel_file_path = os.path.join(monthly_attendance_folder, excel_file_name)\n","\n","    # Check if the file exists\n","    if not os.path.exists(excel_file_path):\n","        print(f\"Excel file '{excel_file_name}' not found.\")\n","        return\n","\n","    # Read the Excel file into a DataFrame\n","    attendance_df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path, index_col=0)\n","\n","    if attendance_df is not None:\n","        # Extract attendance insights\n","        attendance_insights = extract_attendance_insights(attendance_df)\n","\n","        # Display attendance insights for each participant\n","        for participant_name, attended_days in attendance_insights.items():\n","            print(f\"Participant: {participant_name}\")\n","            print(\"Attended Days (Month/Day):\")\n","            print(\", \".join(attended_days))\n","            print(\"-\" * 30)\n","\n","        # Calculate and display attendance per day\n","        day_participants = count_attendance_per_day(attendance_insights)\n","        print(\"\\nAttendance per Day:\")\n","        for day, count in day_participants.items():\n","            print(f\"{day} - Total participants {count}\")\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","    main()\n"]}]}
