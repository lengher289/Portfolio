This becomes especially important when dealing with senior individuals who may not be technologically literate. To simplify this process, a Python script has been developed to automate the file management for participant folders. This script enables the easy distribution and deletion of files among a group of participants.\n","\n","## Features\n","\n","### The script offers several key features:\n","\n","1. Sending Files: Users can send a specified file to all participant folders with just a few commands. This feature is extremely useful for sharing important documents, such as schedules, templates, or guidelines, with multiple participants simultaneously.\n","\n","2. Deleting Files: The script provides options for file deletion. Users can choose to delete the file only from its original location or from both the original location and all participant folders. This feature ensures that files are removed efficiently when they are no longer needed.\n","\n","3. User-Friendly Interface: The script incorporates an intuitive user interface. Users are prompted for file names, actions (send or delete), and deletion scope (original location only or all participant folders). The program guides users through each step and provides options to cancel operations at any point.\n","\n","4. Error Handling: Robust error handling is implemented. The script checks if the specified file exists and ensures that users input valid choices. Users are given the option to cancel operations at any time to prevent accidental file transfers or deletions.\n","\n","## How It Works\n","\n","> Initialization: The script begins by listing all participant folders in the specified directory. It then enters a loop to continuously ask the user for a Docx file name.\n","\n","> User Choices: Users can either choose to send the file to all participant folders or delete it. If the user chooses to delete the file, they are asked whether to delete it only from the original location or from all participant folders as well.\n","\n","> Cancellation: At any point during the process, users can choose to cancel the operation by typing 'cancel'. The script respects this choice and terminates gracefully.\n","\n","> Sending Files: If the user selects to send the file, the script copies the file to all participant folders, providing feedback for each operation. This feature streamlines the distribution of essential files to all participants in one go.\n","\n","? Deleting Files: If the user selects to delete the file, they can specify whether to delete it only from the original location or from all participant folders. The script then proceeds to delete the file as per the user's choice, offering clear feedback on each deletion.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","> This Python script offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing files in participant folders. It simplifies the process of distributing and deleting files, making it a valuable tool for organizations and institutions that work with senior individuals who may not be tech-savvy. Its intuitive interface and error handling mechanisms ensure smooth and reliable file management, enhancing overall efficiency and productivity."],"metadata":{"id":"lxP9x0vYUlhJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# BEFORE RUNNING MAKE SURE THE FILE YOU WANT TO SEND OR DELETE IN ALL FOLDERS IS LOCATED AT THE RIGHT FOLDER\n","\n","# My Drive/Leng Her/Scripts/(File Name)"],"metadata":{"id":"Jp7ogKbDUoO5"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Agy4NzrgUkA9"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import shutil\n","\n","def send_docx_file_to_participants(file_path, participant_folders):\n","    for participant_folder in participant_folders:\n","        participant_file_path = os.path.join(participant_folder, os.path.basename(file_path))\n","        shutil.copy(file_path, participant_file_path)\n","        print(f\"File '{os.path.basename(file_path)}' sent to participant folder '{os.path.basename(participant_folder)}'.\")\n","\n","def delete_docx_file(file_path, participant_folders, delete_everywhere=False):\n","    if delete_everywhere:\n","        for participant_folder in participant_folders:\n","            participant_file_path = os.path.join(participant_folder, os.path.basename(file_path))\n","            if os.path.exists(participant_file_path):\n","                os.remove(participant_file_path)\n","                print(f\"File '{os.path.basename(file_path)}' deleted from participant folder '{os.path.basename(participant_folder)}'.\")\n","    else:\n","        os.remove(file_path)\n","        print(f\"File '{os.path.basename(file_path)}' deleted from its original location.\")\n","\n","def main():\n","    # Define the path to the folder containing participant folders\n","    participants_folder = '/content/drive/My Drive/Individual Timesheets/'\n","\n","    # List participant folders\n","    participant_folders = [os.path.join(participants_folder, folder) for folder in os.listdir(participants_folder) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(participants_folder, folder))]\n","\n","    while True:\n","        # Ask the user for the name of the docx file to send\n","        file_name = input(\"Enter the name of the Word file (e.g., MyFile.docx) or 'cancel' to terminate: \")\n","\n","        if file_name.lower() == 'cancel':\n","            print(\"Program terminated.\")\n","            return\n","\n","        # Define the full path to the Docx file\n","        excel_file_path = os.path.join('/content/drive/My Drive/Leng Her/Scripts/', file_name)\n","\n","        # Check if the file exists\n","        if not os.path.exists(excel_file_path):\n","            print(f\"Docx file '{file_name}' not found.
