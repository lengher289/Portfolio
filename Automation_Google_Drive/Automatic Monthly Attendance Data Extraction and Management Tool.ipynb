This tool is meant to be used for the WADS attendance system but can be altered to accommodate Other systems using Google Drive.\n","\n","\n","## Features:\n","\n","### Google Drive Integration:\n","\n","> The script integrates with Google Drive to access and save files, making it convenient for users who store their attendance data in the cloud.\n","\n","### User Interaction:\n","> The program interacts with the user to gather the necessary input, such as the name of the individual timesheet file (docx format), which should be consistent across all participant folders.\n","\n","### File Existence Check:\n","\n","> The script checks the existence of the specified timesheet file in all participant folders. If the file is missing in some folders, it provides the user with a list of folders where the file is absent.\n","\n","### User Confirmation:\n","\n","> The user is given the option to continue with the data extraction process even if some files are missing. This feature allows for flexibility when certain participants may not have submitted their timesheets.\n","\n","### Data Extraction:\n","\n","> The tool extracts data from the specified timesheet file in each participant folder. It parses the tables in the document and stores the relevant information in a structured format.\n","\n","### Attendance Classification:\n","\n","> The program classifies attendance for each date as \"Attended\" or \"Not Attended\" based on the presence of time entries in the timesheet. It handles variations in time entry formats and accounts for missing or invalid dates.\n","\n","### Data Aggregation:\n","\n","> Extracted attendance data for each participant is aggregated into a single DataFrame, making it easy to manage and analyze attendance records for multiple individuals.\n","\n","### Excel Export:\n","\n","> The tool exports the aggregated attendance data to an Excel file. The filename is generated based on the month and year of the attendance data, ensuring organized storage.\n","\n","### Google Drive Saving:\n","\n","> The Excel file is saved to a specified folder in Google Drive. If a file with the same name already exists in that folder, the script provides the option to replace it or skip the saving process.\n","\n","### User-Friendly Interface:\n","\n","> The program includes user-friendly prompts and messages to guide the user through the process, making it accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.\n","\n","## Usage:\n","\n","\n","\n","1.   Run the cell containing '!pip install python-docx' to install the necessary dependencies.\n","\n","2.   Mount Google Drive: The script begins by mounting Google Drive to access files.\n","\n","3. Enter File Name: The user is prompted to enter the name of the individual timesheet file (including the .docx extension) that should be consistent across all participant folders.\n","\n","4. Check for File Existence: The script checks if the specified file exists in each participant's folder and compiles lists of confirmed and unconfirmed folders.\n","\n","5. User Confirmation: If some folders do not contain the specified file, the user is asked whether they want to continue with the data extraction process.\n","\n","6. Data Extraction: The script extracts attendance data from the specified timesheet file in each participant folder and classifies attendance.\n","\n","7. Data Aggregation: Extracted data is aggregated into a single DataFrame for all participants.\n","\n","8. Excel Export: The aggregated data is exported to an Excel file with a filename based on the month and year.\n","\n","9. Google Drive Saving: The Excel file is saved to a specified folder in Google Drive. The user is given the option to replace existing files.\n","\n","# Conclusion:\n","\n","> The Automatic Monthly Attendance Data Extraction and Management Tool simplifies the process of handling attendance data for organizations and institutions with multiple participants. It offers convenience, data organization, and user-friendly interactions, making it a valuable asset for efficient attendance management.\n","\n","Note: Ensure that the necessary Python libraries (pandas, docx, Google Colab dependencies) are installed to run the script successfully.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nBpWcT6FT_ew"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"BXh1sHX9b5mk"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install python-docx"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","\n","#Import Dependencies\n","import pandas as pd\n","from docx import Document\n","from google.colab import drive\n","import os\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import shutil\n","\n","\n","def save_to_drive(attendance_df):\n","  # Create a file name based on the date\n","  date_column = attendance_df.columns[0]# Assuming the date is in the first column\n","  # Extract the date from the date string\n","  date_str = date_column  # Date format is 'MM/DD/YYYY'\n","  date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%m/%d/%Y')\n","  # Create the file name using the month and year\n","  month_name = date_obj.strftime('%B')  # Extract month name\n","  year = date_obj.strftime('%Y')  # Extract year\n","  file_name = f\"{month_name}_{year}_Attendance.xlsx\"\n","\n","  # Define the file path for the Excel file\n","  excel_file_path = os.path.join('/content', file_name)\n","\n","  # Save the DataFrame to an Excel file with the new file name\n","  attendance_df.to_excel(excel_file_path)\n","\n","  # Define the destination folder in Google Drive\n","  destination_folder = '/content/drive/My Drive/Monthly Attendance/'\n","\n","  check_ls = os.listdir(destination_folder)#list of files in monthly attendance folder\n","\n","  if file_name in check_ls:\n","    #if the file already exist\n","    # if the file already exist ask user if they wish to replace the existing file or to stop and not save the file\n","    #if failed to save return -1\n","    user_choice = input(f\"The file '{file_name}' already exists in Google Drive.
